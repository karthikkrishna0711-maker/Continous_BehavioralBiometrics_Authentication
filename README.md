The growing dependency on digital platforms has increased the need for robust security mechanisms to ensure that users interacting with systems are legitimate. User authentication methods such as passwords, biometrics, and CAPTCHA often serve as the first line of defense. However, these traditional methods are not foolproof, especially against advanced bots and unauthorized users attempting to mimic human behavior. This project, "Continuous Behavioural Biometrics using Machine Learning," introduces a complementary approach by leveraging behavioral biometrics to enhance system security.

Behavioral biometrics analyze user interaction patterns such as mouse movements, mouse clicks, typing speed, and scrolling speeds to identify unique characteristics of human behavior. Unlike static authentication methods, behavioral data offers a dynamic layer of verification that can operate continuously during a session. This project focuses on collecting user interaction data, identifying behavioral patterns, and training a machine learning model to distinguish between legitimate users and potential threats, including bots and unauthorized users.

Data collection is implemented using JavaScript for capturing mouse and keyboard interactions in real-time. Parameters such as average x and y-axis movement, number of clicks, typing speed, scrolling speed, and a label indicating whether the session is authorized or not are calculated. Flask serves as the backend for transmitting this data to a PostgreSQL database. Over 530 interaction sessions were recorded and processed, resulting in a comprehensive dataset that was exported to CSV format for analysis.

To detect anomalies, a decision tree-based machine learning model was developed. Decision trees were chosen for their simplicity, interpretability, efficiency and high accuracy in classification tasks. After training and validating the model, it was integrated into the Flask backend to enable real-time predictions. The system continuously monitors user behavior, and upon detecting an unauthorized user or bot-like activity, it triggers a security response. This response includes sending an email alert to the administrator and automatically logging out the user from the session.
	
This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional security measures and the growing need for real-time, behavior-based detection systems. By combining behavioral analysis with machine learning, it provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing cybersecurity in various applications.
